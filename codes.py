                A piece of text focused on a Payment Channel Network (PCN) or a similar payment system, excluding the Lightning Network as the primary subject. 
                It discusses the challenges, perspectives, and potential solutions — whether new or modified — related to the PCN. 
                The Lightning Network may be mentioned, but the main focus should be on another Payment Channel Network, possibly one built upon or compared to the Lightning Network.
